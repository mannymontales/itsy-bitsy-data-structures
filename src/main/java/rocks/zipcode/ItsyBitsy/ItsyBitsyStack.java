 *
 * These data structures focus on doing two things:
 *
 *   - Organizing data based on how it is used
 *   - Abstracting away implementation details
 *
 * These data structures focus on creating an organization that makes sense for
 * various types of programs. They insert a language that allows you to discuss
 * more complicated logic. All of this while abstracting away implementation
 * details so that their implementation can change to be made faster.

/**
