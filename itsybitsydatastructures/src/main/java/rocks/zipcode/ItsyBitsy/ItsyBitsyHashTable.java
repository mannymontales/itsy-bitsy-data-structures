     * In order to store key-value pairs in memory from our hash table we need a
     * way to take the key and turn it into an address. We do this through an

     *
     * Basically it takes a key and serializes it into a unique number for that
     * key.
     *
     * hashKey("abc") => 96354
     * hashKey("xyz") => 119193
     *
     * You have to be careful though, if you had a really big key you don't want
     * to match it to a memory address that does not exist.
     *
     * So the hashing algorithm needs to limit the size, which means that there
     * are a limited number of addresses for an unlimited number of values.
     *
     * The result is that you can end up with collisions. Places where two keys
     * get turned into the same address.
     *
     * Any real-world hash table implementation would have to deal with this,
     * however, we are just going to glaze over it and pretend that doesn't happen.
